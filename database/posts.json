Dogs, cats, and other pets have their own special things they do, even if it ain't what humans call 'smart.' Like, dogs are super loyal and can learn tricks, and cats, well, they can figure stuff out too sometimes. People think pets are dumb 'cause they don't get what animals are about, but we should just enjoy the cute and fun things they do instead of thinking about their brains. Pets just bring joy and company, and that's what really counts!",
